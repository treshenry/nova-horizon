      <h1>Community Guidelines for Nova Horizon SMP</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to <em>Nova Horizon</em> where friends and family come together
        to explore, create, and have fun!
      </p>

      <p>
        Our server is a safe place where players of all ages, including young
        children, gather to share in the joy of Minecraft. To ensure everyone
        has a great time, weâ€™ve established a few simple guidelines. Please take
        a moment to familiarize yourself with them.
      </p>

      <p>
        1. ðŸ˜Š <strong>Be Kind and Respectful</strong>&mdash;Treat all players
        with kindness and respect. This is
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_British_Bake_Off"
          >The Great British Bake Off</a

          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell%27s_Kitchen_(American_TV_series)"
          >Hell's Kitchen</a
        >. Support each other. Help out if someone is stuck, lost, or looking
        for inspiration.
      </p>

      <p>
        2. ðŸ§’ <strong>Keep It Family-Friendly</strong>&mdash;Our server is
        kid-friendly, so please avoid swearing, rude language, or inappropriate
        topics. Letâ€™s keep our conversations and creations suitable for all
        ages. No discussions about politics, religion, or other sensitive
        topics. Our focus is on enjoying the game and the company.
      </p>

      <p>
        4. ðŸ“£ <strong>Communication Is Key</strong>&mdash;Use the server chat to
        stay in touch, plan projects, or ask for help. Letâ€™s make sure it
        remains a positive and inclusive space for everyone. If you have
        concerns or someone is not following the guidelines, please reach out to
        <em>tres@treshenry.net</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        5. ðŸ¥³ <strong>Have Fun!</strong>&mdash; Explore, create, and enjoy.
        Minecraft offers endless possibilities, and together, we can make Nova
        Horizon a wonderful place to escape the shenanigans of RL. ðŸ’›
